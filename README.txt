Date: 5/24/2023
IDE used: IntelliJ Community 2021.1.3 x64
JDK version used: Java SE 17.0.1
JavaFX version used: JavaFX-SDK-17.0.1

How to run the program:
Open the project files into an IDE and run the program. Once the program boots, enter the correct login information to get to the records screen. The records screen holds table views for a customer table and
an appointments table. Each table has buttons underneath it to add, update or delete items from those lists; and at the bottom of the records screen there is a button to take the user to the reports screen.

Additional report: I did my third report to show how many appointments any customer has. The user selects a customer from the dropdown menu and presses the 'view report' button so that the program prints
out a string including how many appointments the selected customer has.
